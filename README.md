### Lab 1: Subroutine\
 - Part 2: Program that determines largest number stored in memory by implementing a Subroutine\
 - Part 3: Program that converts a Binary number into 2 Decimal digits

**Lab 2: Bit Manipulation\
- Part 2: Program that counts number of consecutive 1's\
- Part 3: Program that determines Longest string of 1's, Longest string of 0's, and Longest string of alternating 1's and 0's in a word of data stored in memory.

**Lab 3: Polling I/O\
- Part 1: Program that displays Hexadecimal digit on seven-segment display HEX0. When KEY0 is pressed, HEX0 displays a 0. When KEY1 is pressed, the number increments by 1 and displays the incremented number on HEX0 (Number does not go beyond 9). When KEY2 is pressed, the number decrements by 1 and displays the decremented number on HEX0 (Number does not go below 0). When KEY3 is pressed, HEX Display becomes a blank screen and pressing any other KEY2-0 afterwards returns the display on HEX0 to 0.

**Lab 4: Interrupt I/O\
- Part 1: Program that displays number 0 to 3 on the HEX0 to HEX3 displays when a corresponding pushbutton KEY0-3 is pressed using Inteerupt Signal.

**Lab 5: Graphics and Animation\
- Part 1: Program that draws a straight line connecting two points on the VGA screen. Determine pixels to plot on screen to construct a straight line path using Bresenham's Algorithm.\
- Part 2: An animation of a Horizontal line moving up and down the screen.\
- Part 3: An animation of eight small filled boxes moving continuously on the VGA screen and bounce off the edges of the screen.

**Lab 7: Simple Processor\
- Designed a Simple Processor in Verilog

**Lab 8: Enhanced Processor\
- Designed an Enhanced Processor in Verilog
