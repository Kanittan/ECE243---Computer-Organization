#### Lab 1: Subroutine
 - Part 2: Program that determines largest number stored in memory by implementing a Subroutine
 - Part 3: Program that converts a Binary number into 2 Decimal digits

#### Lab 2: Bit Manipulation
- Part 2: Program that counts number of consecutive 1's
- Part 3: Program that determines Longest string of 1's, Longest string of 0's, and Longest string of alternating 1's and 0's in a word of data stored in memory.

#### Lab 3: Polling I/O
- Part 1: Program that displays Hexadecimal digit on seven-segment display HEX0. When KEY0 is pressed, HEX0 displays a 0. When KEY1 is pressed, the number increments by 1 and displays the incremented number on HEX0 (Number does not go beyond 9). When KEY2 is pressed, the number decrements by 1 and displays the decremented number on HEX0 (Number does not go below 0). When KEY3 is pressed, HEX Display becomes a blank screen and pressing any other KEY2-0 afterwards returns the display on HEX0 to 0.

#### Lab 4: Interrupt I/O
- Part 1: Program that displays number 0 to 3 on the HEX0 to HEX3 displays when a corresponding pushbutton KEY0-3 is pressed using Inteerupt Signal.

#### Lab 5: Graphics and Animation
- Part 1: Program that draws a straight line connecting two points on the VGA screen. Determine pixels to plot on screen to construct a straight line path using Bresenham's Algorithm.
- Part 2: An animation of a Horizontal line moving up and down the screen.
- Part 3: An animation of eight small filled boxes moving continuously on the VGA screen and bounce off the edges of the screen.

#### Lab 7: Simple Processor
- Designed a Simple Processor in Verilog

#### Lab 8: Enhanced Processor
- Designed an Enhanced Processor in Verilog

#### Open Software Final Project: Soccer Game
- Programmed an entire Soccer Game using C Programming Language.
- Game Objective: Score 10 goals to win the game
- Game Ends When: Player hits wall OR when Player scores 10 Goals

- Implemented Interrupts from I/O Decive (Up Arrow, Down Arrow, and Pushbutton KEY0 from the keyboard keys)
- Use Up Arrow and Down Arrow from keyboard to control the player's movement Up/Down
- Pressing on Pushbutton KEY0 shoots the ball from the palyer's right foot
- Number of goal(s) scored is updated displayed on the HEX Display when ball hits the goal
- Ball disappears when hits wall and the goal
- When player scores 10 goals, "You Win" is displayed onto the HEX Display
- Coded the moving walls and goals

- To play game:
  - 1.)Go to https://cpulator.01xz.net/
  - 2.)Select ARMv7 for Architecture and ARMv7 DE1-SoC for System.
  - 3.)Change Language from "ARMv7" to "C"
  - 4.) Copy and paste the code into the IDE
  - 5.) Click Compile and Load
